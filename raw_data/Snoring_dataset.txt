The dataset contains two folders - one for snoring and the other for non-snoring. 

Folder 1 contains snoring sounds. It has total 500 sounds. Each sound is 1 second in duration.
Among the 500 snoring samples, 363 samples consist of snoring sounds of children, adult men and adult women without any background sound. The remaining 137 samples consist of snoring sounds having a background of non-snoring sounds.
